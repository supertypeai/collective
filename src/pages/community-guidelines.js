                                    Members in the Supertype Collective are expected to help one another. Whether participating in a discussion on our Discord channel, mentoring something new, or offering advice, we expect members to be constructive and supportive.
                                    We want a community that look out for each other.

                                    If your participation is highly self-serving (e.g engaging in excessive self-promotion, or asking for help without offering anything in return), you may be asked to leave the community.

                                    Members in the Supertype Collective are expected to be committed to their craft. We want to be a community of people who are passionate about what they do, and are always looking to improve
                                    themselves and the people around them. You are encouraged to share your work, and propose ideas that elevate this community and its members.

                                                As mentors, your Sessions availability must be kept up to date, so you can be booked by Mentees. You must attend all Sessions you are matched with, unless under extenuating circumstances and are able to provide
                                                a notice of at least 24 hours. Collected fees will be refunded and you will be marked as a no-show. Repeated no-shows will result in your mentorship privileges being revoked.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                As mentees, you must attend Sessions you have booked with your mentor unless a valid reason is provided and a notice of at least 24 hours is given. In most cases, Supertype will negotiate a reschedule with
                                                your mentor if you are unable to attend for a valid reason. No-shows without a valid reason and/or notice will result in the Session being marked as abandoned, and no refund will be provided.

                                                As mentors, you want to be empathetic, proactive and kind in all your interactions with your mentees. Be the mentor you wish you had when you were starting out. <br />
                                                <br />
                                                As mentees, you want to be respectful of your mentor&apos;s time and effort. This can be reflected by being prepared for your Sessions, showing up on time, and being appreciative of the work your mentor has put in to help you.
