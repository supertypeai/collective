### Building Blocks 
At its core, Supertype Collective comes with a set of React components that can be used to build your profile. We call them "blocks". They are built with Tailwind CSS and are available in the `blocks` directory.

Below is a semi-complete example. You can see the output of these blocks on Supertype's co-founder [Samuel Chan](https://collective.supertype.ai/p/samuel)'s Developer Profile using these pre-made blocks:

```js
import me from '@/data/profiles/<your-name>.json'

export async function getStaticProps() {
    ...
    return {
        props: {
            data: me
        },
    }
}

const MyStack = () => {
    return (
        <Stack>
            <StackSection sectionName="AI &#38; Data">
                <IconRow tags={['pytorch', 'r', 'sql']} />
                <IconRow tags={['numpy', 'pandas', 'sklearn']} />
            </StackSection>
            ...
        </Stack>
    )
}

const Profile = ({ data }) => {    
    return (
        <Mainframe data={data}>
            <Toprow />
            <Body stack={<MyStack />} affiliations={<Affiliations />} />
        </Mainframe>
    )
}
```

Once you're done editing your Developer Profile (`data/profiles/<your-name>.json` and `pages/p/<your-name>.json)`, run `yarn build` to generate a production build and confirm that there are no warnings. You can now push it to GitHub and open a pull request to merge your changes into the `main` branch, where it will be deployed onto the Collective platform, waiting for you to share with the world!
